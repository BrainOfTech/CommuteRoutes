                    Over the past week, most of my work has been on the design document and algorithmic design for feature extraction. The development of these algorithms involved learning more about statistics, doing some cursory runtime analysis, and some team decision making on the input and output formats of the algorithm. A description of the algorithms can be found in the <a href="Design.html">design document</a>.

                    During the past week, I met with Andrew Hedrick, from UK's Office of Research Integrity, to discuss the IRB application to collect human subjects data, and how to ensure that our design minimizes the risk of harm to the participants.

                    I was travelling Tuesday through Thursday, and so was only able to work a limited amount amount this week on CommuteRoutes. I did, however, begin implementation of the path/location identification algorithm. So far no significant problems have been encountered.

                    I continued work on the implementation of the processing script, met with the client to discuss user interfaces, and met with the team to discuss our testing plan. There were no significant problems. Unfortunately, it has taken me longer than expected to get the proposal for human subjects data collection together, but I also worked on that and in light of my previous meeting with the Office of Research Integrity, I do not believe any significant changes to our design will be necessary.

                    I resolved some computational issues with using the coefficient of correlation to determine whether or not a given sequence of points is a location. Specifically, computing an exact p-value for a given correlation coefficient and number of samples is computationally expensive, but I fitted a function to the curve of correlation coefficients versus number of samples for a 95% confidence, and this is much cheaper to compute. I also participated in the team discussion of how to keep the database secure from both malicious users and exposure of data. The plan we came up with involves signed messages from the processing script to the database, so that delete requests cannot be spoofed.
