                    Over the past week, most of my work has been on the design document and algorithmic design for feature extraction. The development of these algorithms involved learning more about statistics, doing some cursory runtime analysis, and some team decision making on the input and output formats of the algorithm. A description of the algorithms can be found in the <a href="Design.html">design document</a>.

                    During the past week, I met with Andrew Hedrick, from UK's Office of Research Integrity, to discuss the IRB application to collect human subjects data, and how to ensure that our design minimizes the risk of harm to the participants.

                    I was travelling Tuesday through Thursday, and so was only able to work a limited amount amount this week on CommuteRoutes. I did, however, begin implementation of the path/location identification algorithm. So far no significant problems have been encountered.
