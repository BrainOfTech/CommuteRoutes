            This week I have worked heavily on the midterm presentation, attended both group meetings, attended the estudio practice presentation, and completed the design of the Client application. The client design diagrams were used both in the presentation powerpoint and in the design documentation. I also created the data flow diagram modeling the entire system.
        </H3>
        <H2> Week of 3/7-3/13</H2>
        <H3>
            This week I have begun implementation of the tracking algorithm. The design has also been posted to the website. I assisted in giving the groups presentation on monday. The client should be basically implemented by the end of spring break.
        </H3>
           <H2> Weeks of 3/14-3/27</H2>
        <H3>
            These past two weeks, I have completed the implementation for setting a home location and setting a work location. The automated tracking has also been completed. It changes tracking and GPS modes according to the state machine in the design document, now. Yet to be implemented is the weather querying protocols. Finally, the send button is implemented, it currently only opens a blank message window. Encryption needs to be implemented aswell as a conversion function to convert the encrypted data into something passable to the email window.
        </H3>
           <H2> Week of 3/28-4/3</H2>
        <H3>
            This week I attended the meeting where the test plan was designed. I created an in depth test plan for all the units inside of the client system. This is now posted on the testing page of our website. I also assisted in the creation and configuration of the server which will host the database, processing script, http server, and email server. 
        </H3>
           <H2> Week of 4/4-4/10</H2>
        <H3>
            This week I have finalized the rough implementation of the Client. It is currently ready for testing. Documentation for the rough implementation has been polished. The GPS data is now categorized in proper routes. All route data is now correctly encrypted with a PGP key retrieved from the server. The server is now configured as an SMTP server and an HTTP server.

            This week I also attended the group meeting at Marksbury. At the meeting we discussed the state of the project, testing methods, and implementation schedules. We also set a date of 5 PM April 27th as the delivery date of the product. This will occur immediately after the presentation in Marksbury Building.
