            This week I have worked heavily on the midterm presentation, attended both group meetings, attended the estudio practice presentation, and completed the design of the Client application. The client design diagrams were used both in the presentation powerpoint and in the design documentation. I also created the data flow diagram modeling the entire system.

        <H2> Week of 3/7-3/13</H2>
        <H3>
            This week I have begun implementation of the tracking algorithm. The design has also been posted to the website. I assisted in giving the groups presentation on monday. The client should be basically implemented by the end of spring break.
        </H3>
           <H2> Weeks of 3/14-3/27</H2>
        <H3>
            These past two weeks, I have completed the implementation for setting a home location and setting a work location. The automated tracking has also been completed. It changes tracking and GPS modes according to the state machine in the design document, now. Yet to be implemented is the weather querying protocols. Finally, the send button is implemented, it currently only opens a blank message window. Encryption needs to be implemented aswell as a conversion function to convert the encrypted data into something passable to the email window.
