        <h1>Welcome to CommuteRoutes!</h1>
        <p>Outline: CommuteRoutes is a software package designed to facilitate the collection of anonymous data reflecting the choices of commuters as they travel from work to home. What influences a person's choice of route? Can a person's choices be predicted or modelled based on factors like time of day or day of the week? How do a person's choices change over time? These are all questions that our client, <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~goldsmit">Dr. Judy Goldsmith</a> would like to be able to answer.</p>
        <!--Brief and general status statement.-->
        <p>CommuteRoutes is currently a work in progress, as part of a senior design project for Computer Science majors at the University of Kentucky during the spring semester of 2016.</p>
