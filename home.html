        <h1>Welcome to CommuteRoutes!</h1>
        <p>Outline: CommuteRoutes is a software package designed to facilitate the collection of anonymous data reflecting the choices of commuters as they travel from work to home. Which route did they take? How fast did they travel? What was the weather like when they left? These are all questions that our client, <a href="http://cs.uky.edu/~goldsmit">Dr. Judy Goldsmith</a> would like to be able to answer.</p>
        <!--Brief and general status statement.-->
        <p>Commute routes is currently a work in progress, as part of a senior design project for Computer Science majors at the University of Kentucky during the spring semester of 2016.</p>
